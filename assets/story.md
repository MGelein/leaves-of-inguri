# Story Document
In this document I will layout any necessary groundwork and/or lore required for the creation of the story of the game. This includes stuff like locations, sounds, music and fights. I will try to organize this game like a D&D campaign since that is what I'm familiar with.

Our hero is summoned by Inguri by a vision (the introduction cinematic) to go and help her, slowly over  the 
course of the arcs her story will be unfolded, as well as your involvement in it

## Quests
Each area in the game can have multiple quests, which, depending on the difficulty and importance of the quest, will give the player some kind of reward. We have four kinds of rewards:

1. Story rewards (minor): These rewards provide some interesting background, but are not necessary for the progression of the game.
2. Equipment / Attribute rewards (normal): These rewards provide a tangible benefit but are, strictly speaking, not required for a player to finish the game. With enough player skill you could finish the game with the starting equipment.
 1. Weapon upgrades: 
  - Club (starting weapon): Provided for free at the start of the game, provides poor damage
  - Trident (given in The Fringe): given by a farmer, as it's one of his old tools.
  - Axe (given in The Lost City)
  - Sword (given in the Inner Sanctum)
 2. Armor upgrades: __four__ tiers of armor upgrades, one for each area, and one starting equipment.
  - Cloth armor (starting armor): Provided for free at the start of the game, provides no protection against enemy damage.
  - Leather armor (given in The Fringe)
  - Chain armor (given in The Lost City)
  - Plate armor (given in The Inner Sanctum)
3. Spell rewards (major): These rewards are required since most, if not all, progression between areas or arcs is gated between the use of these spells. Using them to their full potential becomes a core part of the gameplay.
 - Heal (given in The Fringe)
 - Talk With Plants (given in the Lost City)
 - Blink (given in the Inner Sanctum)
 4. Stat rewards (normal): Over the course of the game the player can receive mana and health in +5 increments as quest rewards. Generally they are given in a 2:1 health:mana ratio.
 5. Control upgrades (major): gives more controlling options
  - Wooden Shield (given in The Fringe). Only blocks a quarter of incoming damage
  - Reinforced Shield (given in The Lost City). Blocks half of all incoming damage
  - Iron Shield (given in The Lost City). Blocks 75% of incoming damage

## Story, in three arcs
Our story will be told in three arcs. Each of these arcs should be a separate story that is able to stand on its own, and ideally they should form a cohesive narrative structure between eachother. Each arc corresponds to one of the three spells, which is obtained during this arc. During each arc we will have 3 distinct areas, each containing some quests (maybe three?). 

### The first arc: The Fringe (Healing)

## Lore and Worldbuilding
The land of Vir, in the kingdom of Lothar.

The gods are dead. The elves have not been seen for centuries. Magic is all but forgotten, and only remains in the legends of old and the fairytales of children. 

Inguri was the godess of Nature, and was one of the first godesses to be killed in an event which was later dubbed the Godkilling or the cleansing.

Mortals tried to steal the power of magic from the gods. To steal the power of Inguri three cultists broke her heart and tried to escape the crime scene. None of them made it far away from the crime scene, all died and guard their piece of heart ever so closely.

The home of Inguri was called Inguri Forest, a beautiful sacred forest where her most important guardians and wood elves lived close to her in harmony.

The Fringe was a thriving farming town at its height due to its fertile soil, but dropped into decline as the elves were never heard from again. Those that dared to venture into the forest and to the Lost City were either never heard from again, or they came back with horrific tales of the undead.

As the hero you have heard of the magic tales of old, and you want to find any remnants of the magic.
