# Story Document
In this document I will layout any necessary groundwork and/or lore required for the creation of the story of the game. This includes stuff like locations, sounds, music and fights. I will try to organize this game like a D&D campaign since that is what I'm familiar with.

## Contents
1. Quests
2. Story, in three arcs.
 1. The first arc: The Fringe (Healing)
 2. The second arc: The Lost City (Talk With Plants)
 3. The third arc: The Inner Sanctum (Blink)
3. Lore and Worldbuilding
4. Items and progression

## Quests
Each area in the game can have multiple quests, which, depending on the difficulty and importance of the quest, will give the player some kind of reward. We have four kinds of rewards:

1. Story rewards (minor): These rewards provide some interesting background, but are not necessary for the progression of the game.
2. Equipment / Attribute rewards (normal): These rewards provide a tangible benefit but are, strictly speaking, not required for a player to finish the game. With enough player skill you could finish the game with the starting equipment.
 1. Weapon upgrades: 
  - Club (starting weapon): Provided for free at the start of the game, provides poor damage
  - Trident (given in The Fringe): given by a farmer, as it's one of his old tools.
  - Axe (given in The Lost City)
  - Sword (given in the Inner Sanctum)
 2. Armor upgrades: __four__ tiers of armor upgrades, one for each area, and one starting equipment.
  - Cloth armor (starting armor): Provided for free at the start of the game, provides no protection against enemy damage.
  - Leather armor (given in The Fringe)
  - Chain armor (given in The Lost City)
  - Plate armor (given in The Inner Sanctum)
3. Spell rewards (major): These rewards are required since most, if not all, progression between areas or arcs is gated between the use of these spells. Using them to their full potential becomes a core part of the gameplay.
 - Heal (given in The Fringe)
 - Talk With Plants (given in the Lost City)
 - Blink (given in the Inner Sanctum)
 4. Stat rewards (normal): Over the course of the game the player can receive mana and health in +5 increments as quest rewards. Generally they are given in a 2:1 health:mana ratio.

## Story, in three arcs
Our story will be told in three arcs. Each of these arcs should be a separate story that is able to stand on its own, and ideally they should form a cohesive narrative structure between eachother. Each arc corresponds to one of the three spells, which is obtained during this arc. During each arc we will have 3 distinct areas, each containing some quests (maybe three?). 

### The first arc: The Fringe (Healing)
The Fringe, a small village on the edge of the sacred woods, is the starting location for our hero. During their first adventures in and around town we discover the source of some of the problems the town has been facing, as well as our first spell.

### The second arc: The Lost City (Talk With Plants)
