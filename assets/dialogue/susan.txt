#greeting
Hello my dear, how is your day so far?
- Really good, I'm enjoying killing all the vermin around! >goodjob
- Rotten, there is so much evil surrounding us here... >poorhero

#goodjob
You're doing a great job handling all those rats my dear. Can I help you somehow?
- Now that you mention it, you could give me a better sword! >nosword
- Come to think of it, can you heal me? >healhero

#poorhero
Oh my poor dear, Is there any way I can help you?
- Now that you mention it, you could give me a better sword! >nosword
- Come to think of it, can you heal me? >healhero

#healhero
:HEAL(100)
That is indeed something I would be able to do... Here you go, all topped up!
- Amazing, thank you and goodbye! >exit

#nosword
Unfortunately I do not have a sword, you should probably ask the blacksmith for that...
- Understandable, have a good day! >exit
