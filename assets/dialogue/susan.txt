Well hello young druid, you look like you have a pair of very green fingers!

Hello my dear, you look hurt, but how is your day?
- Really good, I'm enjoying killing all the vermin around! >goodjob

You're doing a great job handling all those rats my dear. Can I help you somehow?
- Now that you mention it, you could give me a better sword! >nosword
- Come to think of it, can you heal me? >healhero

Oh my poor dear, Is there any way I can help you?
- Now that you mention it, you could give me a better sword! >nosword
- Come to think of it, can you heal me? >healhero

:HEAL(100)
That is indeed something I would be able to do... Here you go, all topped up!
- Amazing, thank you and goodbye! >exit

Nope sorry, you are already fully healed!
- Bitch! >exit

#nosword
{susanHasNoSword == true}
I already told you I have no sword, so you might want to scurry off. Go and ask the blacksmith!
- Sorry m'lady, I will do better next time! >exit

{DEFAULT}
:SET(susanHasNoSword)
Unfortunately I do not have a sword, you should probably ask the blacksmith for that...
- Understandable, have a good day! >exit
