Now that you mention it... I just happen to have an adventure for you. Interested in killing some vermin?
- Please tell me more. >ratProblemExplained

I have rats in my basement, who keep coming back to destroy my wares. Wanna help me?
- Still interested... >ratProblemOptions
- No. >exit

Great. You can use your club, but I would prefer keeping the floors clean. The other option is to use the poison that I store in my office in the basement.
- Sounds good. >ratProblemAccepted
- I've changed my mind. Good luck with the rats. >exit
