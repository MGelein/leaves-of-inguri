# Leaves of Inguri
This is both the engine and the content for a very simple rpg/adventure game. After developing the Galleons game, a local multiplayer ship fighting game, I decided it was time to try to make a real game. I had no idea even a small RPG would be such a big project.

Anyway, browse the source in this repo at your leisure, it probably contains all kinds of aweful code, but it might just inspire you to do your own awful stuff.
